> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are base mechanics, not finished products.
> If you want it to behave differently, you'll need sufficient knowledge of your server environment and Lua scripting to integrate these changes.

> [!INFO]
> Configuration for each of the events handling is done in it's respective file in `./client/events/*.lua`
